Topic: **Aspect Based Opinion Mining on Restaurant Reviews**

The rapid growth of the internet has transformed how businesses operate and interact with their customers. Social media platforms now host an ever-increasing number of reviews, as people are eager to express their opinions and share their experiences online. These online reviews have become a valuable resource across various domains such as intelligent marketing, business analytics, and decision-making.

However, the overwhelming number of reviews for popular products or services often in the thousands makes it difficult for potential customers to process and form informed opinions. To address this challenge, a machine learningâ€“based solution is required.

This research investigates Aspect-Based Opinion Mining, which identifies and evaluates key aspects of textual reviews along with their sentiment polarity (positive, negative, or neutral). Automating this process allows users to efficiently grasp essential insights without reading through large volumes of data.

In particular, the work applies these techniques to restaurant reviews, seeking to understand customer opinions, uncover actionable feedback, and predict behavioral trends. Empirical evaluation on benchmark datasets using diverse machine learning models demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach against established state-of-the-art methods.
