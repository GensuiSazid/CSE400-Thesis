# CSE400-Thesis

The way businesses are operating have changed due to the explosion of the internet.
Social media has an increasing number of reviews as people are keen to express their
opinions based on their experiences. Online reviews have become a precious asset in
various disciplines such as intelligent marketing and decision-making.The number of
reviews for a well-liked product might reach thousands. This makes it challenging
for a prospective buyer to go through them and make up their minds. In order to
overcome this challenge, a machine-learning system is needed. Aspect based Opinion
mining can be used to extract the aspects from the reviews, then we can analyze the
nature of the reviews and recommend them to all the customers. We plan to classify
reviews about a target entity as positive, negative and neutral so that readers of
the reviews do not have to go through all the reviews but instead can focus on
functional items and applicable suggestions. This thesis is specifically focused on
reviews in the domain of restaurants. This study extends our knowledge of online
reviews by taking into account usersâ€™ wants and anticipating their future behavior.
Several distinct evaluative linguistic nuances shed light on internet reviews. Using
an assortment of models on generated benchmark datasets, we will also empirically
show the efficacy of our strategy and show that the new techniques (or modified
versions) are superior to, or at least on par with, state-of-the-art methods.
