Topic: **Aspect Based Opinion Mining on Restaurant Reviews**

The rapid growth of the internet has transformed how businesses operate and interact with their customers. Social media platforms now host an ever-increasing number of reviews, as people are eager to express their opinions and share their experiences online. These online reviews have become a valuable resource across various domains such as intelligent marketing, business analytics, and decision-making.

However, the overwhelming number of reviews for popular products or services—often in the thousands—makes it difficult for potential customers to process and form informed opinions. To address this challenge, a machine learning–based solution is required.

This thesis focuses on **Aspect-Based Opinion Mining**, a technique used to extract key aspects from reviews and analyze their corresponding sentiments (positive, negative, or neutral). By automatically classifying and summarizing opinions, this system can help readers focus on meaningful insights rather than manually reading every review.

The study specifically focuses on restaurant reviews, aiming to understand customer preferences, highlight functional feedback, and anticipate user behavior. Through the use of benchmark datasets and a variety of machine learning models, we will empirically evaluate our approach and demonstrate that our proposed methods are comparable to, or exceed, current state-of-the-art techniques.
